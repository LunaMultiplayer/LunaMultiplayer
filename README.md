# Luna Multiplayer Mod (LMP)

*Multiplayer mod for [Kerbal Space Program (KSP)](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com)*

*[Official KSP forum post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/168271-131-luna-multiplayer-lmp-alpha/)*

*[Latest build updater](https://github.com/LunaMultiplayer/LunaMultiplayerUpdater)*

### Main features:

- [x] Clean and optimized code, based on systems and windows which makes it easier to read and modify.
- [x] Multi threaded.
- [x] [NTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) protocol to sync the time between clients and the server.
- [x] [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) based using the [Lidgren](https://github.com/lidgren/lidgren-network-gen3) library for reliable UDP message handling.
- [x] [Interpolation](http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/entity-interpolation.html) so the vessels won't jump when there are bad network conditions.
- [x] Multilanguage.
- [x] [Nat-punchtrough](../../wiki/Master-server) feature so a server doesn't need to open ports on it's router.
- [x] Servers displayed within the mod.
- [x] Settings saved as XML.
- [x] [UPnP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play) support for servers and [master servers](../../wiki/Master-server)
- [x] Better creation of network messages so they are easier to modify and serialize.
- [x] Every network message is cached in order to reduce the garbage collector spikes.
- [x] Based on tasks instead of threads.
- [x] Supports career and science modes.
- [ ] [QuickLZ](http://www.quicklz.com) for fast compression.
- [ ] Support for groups/companies inside career and science modes.

### Contributing:

Consider [donating trough paypal](https://paypal.me/gavazquez) if you like this project. 
It will encourage us to do future releases and add new features :star:

Please write the code as you were going to leave it, return after 1 year and you'd have to understand what you wrote.  
It's **very** important that the code is clean and documented so in case someone leaves, another programmer could take and maintain it. Bear in mind that **nobody** likes to take a project where it's code looks like a dumpster.

There's also a test project in case you want to add tests to your code.
